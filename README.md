# Project_Grants_and_Foundations

The Foundations and Grants Network Analysis project was a comprehensive endeavor focused on extracting meaningful insights from data obtained through scraping the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records. The primary objective was to unravel the complex web of relationships within the philanthropic ecosystem by meticulously examining the financial transactions and interactions between foundations and the grants they disbursed.

The process involved leveraging web scraping techniques to gather extensive data from the IRS, encompassing details such as financial transactions, grant allocations, and organizational structures. This rich dataset served as the foundation for our in-depth analysis.

Through careful examination, we aimed to identify patterns, trends, and interconnections within the network of foundations and grants. This analysis enabled us to gain a nuanced understanding of how funds flow within the philanthropic sector, highlighting influential entities, emerging trends, and potential areas for further exploration.

By scrutinizing the data obtained from the IRS, we sought to contribute valuable insights that could inform strategic decision-making within the philanthropic landscape. The Foundations and Grants Network Analysis project represents a step towards enhancing transparency, efficiency, and informed decision-making within the realm of charitable giving and foundation activities.
